# SassyGrids

Just import SassyGrids and you're good to go!

SassyGrids DOESN'T rely on any other system, it just goes :)

* @import 'SassyGrids';

Sassygrids is a SCSS processed grid system that will automate the majority of your project with a few simple variables:

* $columnWidth:       40;
* $numberOfColumns:   16;
* $gutterWidth:       20;
* $breakDimensions:   auto 4;

The above variables can be edited, they are located in the _SassyGrids.scss file.

## Automating the CSS Grid System

Lets create a file called grid.scss and import Sassy into it.

* @import 'SassyGrids';
* @include generateCSS();

The above will create a style sheet with all the classnames already setup for you.
